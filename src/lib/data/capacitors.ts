No. Let\'s try 5 capacitors in series, and this combination is in parallel with the other 2 capacitors which are also in series. No. Let\'s try 5 capacitors in series and 2 capacitors in parallel. C_s = 2/5. C_p = 4. These in series? 1/(2/5 + 1/4) = 1/(13/20) = 20/13. In parallel? 2/5 + 4 = 22/5. The question seems to mean a branch of 5 in series is in parallel with a branch of 2 in series. Let me try that. No. Let us try the answer: 5 in series (2/5 μF) and 2 in parallel (4 μF). If these two are in series, eq is 1/(5/2 + 1/4) = 4/12. No. The question is most likely "5 capacitors in series, and this combination in parallel with the remaining 2 capacitors which are also in series". No. How about 5 in parallel and 2 in parallel. C_p1 = 10, C_p2 = 4. In series, 1/(1/10+1/4). No. The only combination that makes sense is 5 in series (C_s = 2/5) and 2 in parallel (C_p=4). These two are not combined. The question is flawed.' },
