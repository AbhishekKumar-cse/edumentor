In CH₃Cl, the methyl group is weakly electron-donating, slightly enhancing the polarity.

Electron-withdrawing groups (-NO₂) decrease basicity, while electron-donating groups (-CH₃, -OCH₃) increase it. The +R effect of -OCH₃ is stronger than the +I/hyperconjugation of -CH₃, making p-anisidine the strongest base. The -R effect of -NO₂ makes p-nitroaniline the weakest base.' },
