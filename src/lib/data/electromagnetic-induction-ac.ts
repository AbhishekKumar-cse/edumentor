Oh, the question has 10 spokes but they are in parallel, so the EMF is the same as for one spoke. Let me re-check the calculation. EMF = 0.5 * 0.4e-4 * 4*pi * 0.25 = 6.28e-5 V = 0.0628 mV. The answer seems off. Let me try again. Perhaps the formula is different. Yes, EMF = (1/2)BωR². Let me use that. EMF = 0.5 * 0.4e-4 * 4*pi * (0.5)^2 = 6.28e-5V. The options are still off. Maybe there is a misunderstanding. Okay, 1 rev/min = 2pi/60 rad/s. 120 rev/min = 120 * 2pi/60 = 4pi rad/s. EMF = 0.5 * B * omega * R^2 = 0.5 * 0.4E-4 T * 4pi rad/s * (0.5m)^2 = 6.28E-5 V = 62.8 μV.
