Bonds formed: 1 C-C, 2 C-H. ΔH = [BE(C=C) + BE(H-H)] - [BE(C-C) + 2BE(C-H)]. Wait, this is hydrogenation of ethene. Bonds broken: 1 C=C, 1 H-H. Bonds formed: 1 C-C, 2 *new* C-H. No, ethene has 4 C-H, ethane has 6 C-H. So Bonds broken: 1 C=C, 1 H-H. Bonds formed: 1 C-C, 2 C-H. ΔH = [606.10 + 431.37] - [336.49 + 2*410.50] = 1037.47 - 1157.49 = -120.02 kJ/mol.' },
