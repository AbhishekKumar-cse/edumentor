ΔH_sol(anhydrous) = ΔH_hyd + ΔH_sol(hydrated). -66.5 = C + B. This implies B is highly negative. Let me rethink. Hydration is exothermic. So C should be negative. The options don\'t match. Maybe heat of hydration of solid is meant? The question is ambiguous. The standard interpretation: ΔHsol(anhydrous) = ΔHhyd(anhydrous salt to form hydrated salt) + ΔHsol(hydrated salt). No, that\'s also not right. Let\'s try ΔH(anhydrous -> solution) = ΔH(anhydrous -> hydrated solid) + ΔH(hydrated solid -> solution). If ΔH_hyd refers to the hydration of anhydrous salt, then C would be negative. Let\'s assume it is. Then B = -66.5 - C. C is likely exothermic. This doesn\'t help. Let\'s assume the cycle CuSO4(s) + aq --> CuSO4(aq) <-- CuSO4.5H2O(s). And CuSO4(s) + 5H2O --> CuSO4.5H2O(s). The question is likely asking for something simpler. It is probably ΔH_sol(hydrated) = ΔH_sol(anhydrous) - ΔH_hydration. -66.5 - (-11.7) = -54.8. Maybe heat of hydration is defined as endothermic? Let\'s assume that. Then -66.5 - (+11.7) = -78.2. Still no match. Let\'s try ΔH_sol(hydrated) = ΔH_sol(anhydrous) + ΔH_hydration = -66.5 + 11.7 = -54.8. This seems most plausible.' },
